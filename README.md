This directory contains an app/ directory, which has the source code. In it is also a docker compose
file to bring up a Flask + Redis stack. Please use this to achieve the following:

1. Design an API to take a name and a phone number and store it in Redis
2. There should be one endpoint for accepting data, and one for retrieving data by name lookup
3. If time permits, consider adding an endpoint that returns all data
4. Please write the code as you would if this was a project currently in production. With all 
   that that entails in your mind!
5. The code is in a git repository, please also use git as you would as part of a team developing
   a tool in a production environment.

The application, once spun up, can be reached on http://localhost:5000
An example "Hello world" route has been created for you.
You may use search engines and any documentation you can find. Please share your thoughts and plans 
with the interviewers as you go along. Feel free to ask questions if needed.
